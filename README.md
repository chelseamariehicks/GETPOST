# GETPOST
Write single page web application that will receive incoming POST and GET requests. For the "single page", it means you should use one URL for both types of requests.  If it is a POST request it should say at the top of the page, in an H1 tag "POST Request Received". If a GET request is received it should say "GET Request Received" in the same H1 tag.  Below that you can, at your discretion, create either a list or a table which clearly shows all parameter names and values which were sent in the URL query string for both a GET and POST request (you can still send stuff in the URL when making a POST request).  Below that, if it is a POST request, you should list, again either in a list or a table, all the property names and values that were received in the request body. It should be able to accepter either a well formatted URL encoded query string (x-www-form-urlencoded) or JSON data.
